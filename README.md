Welcome to my GitHub repository! This code creates a CSS Grid with a grid-container class that displays a grid layout with 3 columns and 1 row, where each column is 300 pixels wide and each row is 400 pixels high.

However, to ensure a better user experience on smaller screens, a media query with a max-width of 650px has been included. This query updates the grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows values for the grid-container class to display a grid with 1 column and 3 rows, where each row is 200 pixels high.

By using CSS Grid with media queries, this website layout can adapt to different screen sizes while maintaining a visually pleasing design. Thank you for checking out my GitHub repository!
